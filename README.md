🛒 E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis: Driving SDG 8 Impact
Project Title
E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis using Big Data Techniques: A Strategic Approach to SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth)

💡 Overview
This project demonstrates how to leverage Big Data analytical techniques to understand and segment e-commerce customer behavior. Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means Clustering, the project transforms high-volume transaction data into actionable business intelligence. The ultimate goal is to optimize business operations, which directly contributes to the targets set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8).

⚙️ Technologies & Methodology
Component	Tool/Method	Purpose
Data Context	Big Data Simulation/RFM	Feature engineering scalable for large transaction volumes.
Programming	Python	Core analysis and scripting.
Clustering	scikit-learn (K-Means)	Unsupervised learning to identify distinct customer segments.
Libraries	pandas, numpy, matplotlib	Data handling, calculation, and visualization.
🌍 SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth Link
The segmentation analysis provides clear, data-driven pathways to support SDG 8:

Sustainable Economic Growth (SDG 8.1 & 8.2):

By isolating the Highest Value Segments (e.g., "Champions"), the business can maximize profitability and efficiency. This financial stability is crucial for sustained investment and responsible economic expansion.

Full and Productive Decent Work (SDG 8.5 & 8.8):

By identifying "At-Risk" customer segments, the company can deploy targeted retention strategies. Stable, predictable revenue streams reduce business volatility, which is essential for guaranteeing job security and promoting higher labor standards (Decent Work) across logistics, customer support, and operations teams.

🚀 Key Deliverables
Customer Segmentation Model: Groups the customer base into distinct behavioral clusters.

Segment Profiles: Summary of the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each group.

Strategic Insights: Clear recommendations on where to invest (High-Value) and where to intervene (At-Risk) to ensure profitable and sustainable business growth.

🛠️ Getting Started
The project utilizes a simulated dataset for a streamlined demonstration. Clone the repository and run the main Python script to replicate the analysis and generate the segment summary.
